    <h1 style="margin: 20px;">Introduction: </h1>
    <p>Abdul Sattar Edhi NI LPP (Urdu: عبد الستار ایدھی; 28 February 1928- 8 July 2016) was a Pakistani humanitarian, philanthropist and ascetic who founded the Edhi Foundation, which runs the world's largest ambulance network, along with homeless shelters, animal shelters, rehabilitation centres, and orphanages across Pakistan.

      Edhi's charitable activities expanded greatly in 1957 when an Asian flu epidemic originating in China swept through Pakistan and the rest of the world. Donations allowed him to buy his first ambulance the same year. He later expanded his charity network with the help of his wife Bilquis Edhi.Following his death, his son Faisal Edhi took over as head of the Edhi Foundation.
      <br>
      
      Over his lifetime, the Edhi Foundation expanded, backed entirely by
       private donations from Pakistani citizens across class, which included establishing a network of 1,800 ambulances. By the time of his death, Edhi was registered as a parent or guardian of nearly 20,000 adopted children. He is known amongst Pakistanis as the "Angel of Mercy" and is considered to be Pakistan's most respected and legendary figure.In 2013, The Huffington Post claimed that he might be "the world's greatest living humanitarian".
      
      Edhi maintained a hands-off management style and was often critical of the corruption commonly found within the religious organizations, clergy and politicians. He was a strong proponent of religious tolerance in Pakistan and extended his support to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the 1985 famine in Ethiopia.He was nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize. Edhi received several domestic as well as international awards such as Ramon Magsaysay Award and the UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize.</p>
